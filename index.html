            <h3>BLACK ENTERTAINMENT LOCATOR
                <br>
                (BEL)
                </h3>
            <p>BEL was created by five Google Fellows who go by the name “Black Innovators”. They noticed how hard it was to find black entertainment whether at home or on the go. 
                Thus, the need for an app to do the work for us created by us.
                <br>
                <br>
            BEL will be capable of detecting the current location of users and allowing them to search for nearby stores, 
            restaurants, movie theatres or interesting events to visit or attend events in the black community.
                <br>
                <br>
            BEL will provide a way to promote black businesses so they can explore, be involved, and give businesses exposure. 
            Users will  have a way to find out how to patronize black owned businesses in familiar and unfamiliar areas so that they will not feel under represented. 
            With this app you will have a way to research black owned venues and events so the user can find things to do, places to go, look at reviews and ratings
            for entertainment in or out of town.
                <br>
                <br>
            This app will  also influence social networking and dating, as BEL allows you to find new people in your area and take 
            advantage of convenient services hassle-free. The best thing about BEL is that it will  present cutting-edge marketing tactics and services for  black businesses.
